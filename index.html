                    Tahimik was born 1942 in Baguio, a colonial hill station created by the Americans after they
                    took
                    the Philippines away from Spain in 1898. He was initially named Eric Oteyza de Guia before he
                    took
                    the nom de plume Kidlat Tahimik, which in his native-tongue Tagalog means “silent lightning”.
                </p>
                <p class="info2">Kidlat Tahimik, born Eric Oteyza de Guia, is an independent filmmaker who primarily
                    advocates for
                    indigenous culture amidst neocolonialism. He
                    has been dubbed the “Father of Philippine Indie Cinema” and was conferred the prestigious Order
                    of
                    National Artist in the field of film and broadcast arts in 2018.</p>
                <p class="info3">As a new wave of independent films came in the 2000s, so did a new generation look
                    back to Kidlat's
                    pioneering work as a source of inspiration. Kidlat received a Lifetime Achievement Awards from
                    the
                    Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino (2008) and the University of the Philippines (2009), the Fukuoka
                    Asian Culture Prize (2012), and the Cinemalaya Award for Outstanding Contribution to Philippine
                    Independent Cinema (2014), in addition to his Lifetime Achievement trophy from the Film Academy
                    of

                    music
                    industry since it bloomed beginning in the 1970s. His skillful and versatile musical style spans
                    a
                    wide range of genres from conservatory or art compositions such as concert religious music,
                    symphonic
                    work, art song, opera, and concerto to mainstream popular idioms in the music industry and in
                    live
                    contemporary shows. Being very visible in mainstream media, Cayabyab is a household name. His
                    compositions reflect a perspective of music that extols the exuberance of life and human
                    happiness,
                    thus
                    capturing the essence of the Filipino soul. </p>
                <p class="info2">He is Famous for composing the Da Coconut Nut Song performed by his Smokey Mountain

                    comparable to Smokey Mountain in the early 1990s. After FreemantleMedia decided not to renew the
                    Philippine Idol franchise, Cayabyab transferred to rival show Pinoy Dream Academy, replacing Jim
                    Paredes as the show's headmaster. PDA 2 started on June 14, 2008. He also became the chairman of

                <h2>Haja Amina Appi</h2>
                <p class="info1">Haja Amina Appi is a Filipino master mat weaver and teacher from the Sama
                    indigenous people of Ungos
                    Matata, Tandubas, Tawi-Tawi. She was credited with creating colorful pandan mats with complex
                    geometric patterns. Her creations were acclaimed for their precise sense of design, proportion
                    and
                    symmetry, and sensitivity to color.

                    She was given the National Living Treasures Award in 2004 by the Philippines through the
                    National
                    Commission for Culture and the Arts.</p>
                <p class="info2">Haja Appi was known for creating finely woven mats with highly intricate designs.
                    An older tradition
                    produced Sama mats in plain white. However, Haja Appi experimented with dyes for her designs,
                    mixing
                    her own dyes to create striking designs for her mats.</p>
                <p class="info3">The entire process of creating mats is handed down exclusively among women among
                    the Sama of
                    Tawi-Tawi. Traditionally it was passed down from mother to daughter. Haja Appi taught many
                    young
                    women in her community the art of mat-making in order to preserve her art for future
                    generations.
